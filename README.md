# NarutoWebAPI
**An application made to hone WebAPI skills.**  
In this application, you can request object data, change and delete them.  
The application uses AutoMapper to convert model objects to DTO.  
You can test this application on your local device. To do this, change the data for connecting to the database in the Programm.cs file and load the data from the seed file.  
To test requests, the Swagger UI is used, which is built in when creating a Web API project.
